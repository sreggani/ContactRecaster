Introduction
------------

We are realising this easy to use code for any user who does not want to REdo mobility experiments but still have realiable mobility traces 

Background
------------



Building
------------

Two possibilities


(1) If you want to run the whole system, rely on https://github.com/neush/ditl to build all the needs.
    
(2) If you already have a mobility trace (Format One) you can directly go to the execution part.
NB: if you have a mobility trace in ns2 you can use The DynamIc Trace Library (ditl) to convert your ns2 trace in format One trace, in that case you need to follow th elink given in (1).
