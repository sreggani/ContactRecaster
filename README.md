Introduction
------------

We are releasing this easy to use code for any user who does not want to REdo mobility experiments to change mobility parameters (transmission range, beaconing period, loss tolerance), but still want to get realiable mobility traces for other different parameters.

Background
------------



Building
------------

Two possibilities:


(1) If you want to run the whole system, rely on https://github.com/neush/ditl to build all the needs.
    
(2) If you already have a mobility trace (Format One) you can directly go to the execution part.

NB: if you have a mobility trace in ns2 you can use The DynamIc Trace Library (ditl) to convert your ns2 trace in format One trace, in that case you need to follow th elink given in (1).
